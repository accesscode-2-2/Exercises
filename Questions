### Easy:



Write a program that asks the user to type 5 integers and writes the average of the 5 integers. This program can use only 2 variables.  


Write a program that asks the user to type all the integers between 8 and 23 (both included) using a for loop.  

Write a program that asks the user to type 10 integers of an array. The program must compute and write how many integers are greater than or equal to 10.    

Write a program with a function that takes two int parameters, adds them together, then returns the sum. The program should ask the user for two numbers, then call the function with the numbers as arguments, and tell the user the sum.  


 



 

Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string.   

Write a function that takes a character and returns True if it is a vowel, False otherwise.  

Write a function translate() that will translate a text into "rövarspråket" (Swedish for "robber's language"). That is, double every consonant and place an occurrence of "o" in between. For example, translate("this is fun") should return the string "tothohisos isos fofunon".  

Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array.. For example, sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10, and multiply([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 24.  

Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("I am testing") should return the string "gnitset ma I".  

Define a function is_palindrome() that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same written backwards). For example, is_palindrome("radar") should return True.  

 





Write a version of a palindrome recognizer that also accepts phrase palindromes such as "Go hang a salami I'm a lasagna hog.", "Was it a rat I saw?", "Step on no pets", "Sit on a potato pan, Otis", "Lisa Bonet ate no basil", "Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas", "I roamed under it as a tired nude Maori", "Rise to vote sir", or the exclamation "Dammit, I'm mad!". Note that punctuation, capitalization, and spacing are usually ignored.  

A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once, for example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Your task here is to write a function to check a sentence to see if it is a pangram or not.  

  

Define a simple "spelling correction" function correct() that takes a string and sees to it that 1) two or more occurrences of the space character is compressed into one, and 2) inserts an extra space after a period if the period is directly followed by a letter. E.g. correct("This   is  very funny  and    cool.Indeed!") should return "This is very funny and cool. Indeed!"   

The third person singular verb form in English is distinguished by the suffix -s, which is added to the stem of the infinitive form: run -> runs. A simple set of rules can be given as follows:  
    - If the verb ends in y, remove it and add ies  
    - If the verb ends in o, ch, s, sh, x or z, add es  
    - By default just add s  
Your task in this exercise is to define a function make_3sg_form() which given a verb in infinitive form returns its third person singular form. Test your function with words like try, brush, run and fix. Note however that the rules must be regarded as heuristic, in the sense that you must not expect them to work for all cases. Tip: Check out the string method.  

Challenging:  

  

Write a program which simulates one or more dice with values from 1 to 6. The program takes a single argument which is the number of dice. The output should contain the values of the dice and the probability for this combination to occur. The probability is expressed as a decimal value between 0 and 1 with three decimal points. Extend the program so that it can roll dice with any number of sides.  
``` 
    Example Run:  
    3  
    Rolling 3 dice ...  
    4 2 8 (Probability: 0.473)  
```
