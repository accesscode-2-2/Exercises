# Week 3:
## Classes, NSArray, NSMutable Array

### Review Questions:

### Excercises:

- Write a function max_in_array() that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest one. 

- Define a function histogram() that takes an array of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example,               histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:

```
    ****
    *********
    *******
```

- Write a function is_member() that takes a value (i.e. a number, string, etc) x and an array of values a, and returns True if x   is a member of a, False otherwise. 

- Define a function overlapping() that takes two arrays and returns True if they have at least one member in common, False        otherwise. (Hint: Try using two nested for-loops.)
