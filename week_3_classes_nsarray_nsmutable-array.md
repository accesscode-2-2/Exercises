# Week 3:
## Classes, NSArray, NSMutable Array

### Review Questions:

### Excercises:

- Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers. Store them in an array. The program must compute and write how      many integers are greater than or equal to 10.    

- Write a function max_in_array() that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest one. 

- Define a function histogram() that takes an array of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example,               histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:

```
    ****
    *********
    *******
```

- Write a function is_member() that takes a value (i.e. a number, string, etc) x and an array of values a, and returns True if x   is a member of a, False otherwise. 

- Define a function overlapping() that takes two arrays and returns True if they have at least one member in common, False        otherwise. (Hint: Try using two nested for-loops.)

**Below this point the problems get a bit more challenging and require a bit more thinking**
- A goat, a wolf and a salad are on one side of a river and you need to get them to the other side using your boat:
    - You can carry one item in your boat to the other side at any given time. However:
        - When the goat and the wolf are left alone the wolf will eat the goat. 
        - If the goat and the salad are left alone the goat will eat the salad.
        - As long as you are with them nothing will happen, i.e. the wolf won’t eat the goat and the goat won’t eat the                salad. 
        
  Write a program which determines algorithmically an order in which you carry them all to the other side.
