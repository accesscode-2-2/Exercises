# Week 2:
## Bubble Sort, Functions, Review Objects, Pairing Objects 

### Review Questions:

- What are the three parts of a function's signature?

### Excercises:
#####*These exercises will test the concepts that we covered in class.*

- Define a function max_of_three() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.  

- Write a program with a function that takes two int parameters, adds them together, then returns the sum. The program should     ask the user for two numbers, then call the function with the numbers as arguments, and tell the user the sum.  

### Challenging Exercises: 
#####*Once you have finished all of the above exercises you can try to complete some of the following more challenging exercises.*

- Write a function translate() that will translate a text into "rövarspråket" (Swedish for "robber's language"). That is, double   every consonant and place an occurrence of "o" in between. For example, translate("this is fun") should return the string       "tothohisos isos fofunon".
