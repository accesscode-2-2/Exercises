# Access Code 2.2 Review Exercises

The goal of this repository is to serve as a place where devs practice what they've learned. Over the course of the next few months we will continue to build a deep bank of exercises for entry-level / junior-level devs. This course is in C/Objective-C but these we should try and build exercises that are language agnostic. 

Click on the topic to you want to review to start practicing.

Good Luck!
