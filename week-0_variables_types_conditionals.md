## Variables, Types, and Conditional Statements 
### Review Questions:  

- What is a variable?  
- What is a pointer?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent integer whole numbers?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent a single character?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent floating point numbers with single precision?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent floating point numbers with double precision?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent true or false?  
- Which Apple primitive type is used to represent an environment aware integer?  
- Which Apple primitive type is used to represent an environment aware floating point number?  
- Which type is used to represent a sequence of characters?  

### Excercises:

- Write a program that asks the user to type 2 integers A and B and exchange the value of A and B.  

- write a program that takes two numbers as nputis and returns the largest of them.  

- Write a program which asks for a student's score. Score is a number from 0-100. Your program should translate the number     score into a letter grade according to the following criteria:  

    - If the score is 100 print "Perfect score!"
    - score >= 90 -> "A"  
    - score >= 80 -> "B"  
    - score >= 70 -> "C"  
    - score >= 60 -> "D"  
    - anything else -> "F"
    - Make sure that your program only prints one grade.
    
- Write a program that asks the user to type an integer and writes "YOU WIN" if the value is between 56 and 78 (both           included). In the other case it writes "YOU LOSE".  

    
- A goat, a wolf and a salad are on one side of a river and you need to get them to the other side using your boat:
    - You can carry one item in your boat to the other side at any given time. However:
        - When the goat and the wolf are left alone the wolf will eat the goat. 
        - If the goat and the salad are left alone the goat will eat the salad.
        - As long as you are with them nothing will happen, i.e. the wolf won’t eat the goat and the goat won’t eat the                salad. 
        
  Write a program which determines algorithmically an order in which you carry them all to the other side.
