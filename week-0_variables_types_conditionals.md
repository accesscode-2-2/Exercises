### Excercises:
#####*These exercises will test the concepts that we covered in class.*

For the following exercises try running your program multiple times each time with a different value of n to make sure it is working correctly.

- Write a program that initializes a variable, `n`, of type **int** with a number of your choice. If `n` is odd then your      program should print the word "odd". If `n` is even then it should print the word "even".

- Write a program that assigns a number to an **int**, n. Your program should print "Multiple of 3", if the number is a         multiple of three, otherwise it should print "Not a Multiple of 3". 

- Write a program that assigns a number to an **int**, n. Your program should print "Odd and Multiple of 3", if the number is   odd and is also a multiple of three, otherwise it should print "Neither".

### Challenging Exercises: 
#####*Once you have finished all of the above exercises you can try to complete some of the following more challenging exercises.*

- Write a program that assigns a value to two integer variables A and B and then exchange the value of A and B.  

- Write a program that takes two numbers as and outputs the larger of the two numbers.  

- Write a program which stores a student's number grade in a variable name score. You can assign score a value between 0 and   100. Your program should translate the number score into a letter grade and then output the letter grade to the console      according to the following criteria:  

        - score = 100 -> "Perfect score!"
        - score >= 90 -> "A"  
        - score >= 80 -> "B"  
        - score >= 70 -> "C"  
        - score >= 60 -> "D"  
        - anything else -> "F"
Make sure that your program only prints one grade.
