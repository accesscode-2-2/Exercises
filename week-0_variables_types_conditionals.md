## Variables, Types, and Conditional Statements 
### Review Questions:  

- What is a variable?  
- What is a pointer?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent integer whole numbers?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent a single character?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent floating point numbers with single precision?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent floating point numbers with double precision?  
- Which primitive type is used to represent true or false?  
- Which Apple primitive type is used to represent an environment aware integer?  
- Which Apple primitive type is used to represent an environment aware floating point number?  
- Which type is used to represent a sequence of characters?  

### Excercises:

- Write a method `isOdd` that takes in an `int` n. Returns a `true` if n is odd, and `false` otherwise.
- Write a method `isMultipleOfThree` that takes in an `int` n. Returns `true` if n is a multiple of three, and `false` otherwise.
- Write a method `isOddAndIsMultipleOfThree` that takes in an `int` n. Returns `true` if n is both odd and a multiple of three, and false otherwise.
- Write a method `isOddAndIsMultipleOfThree2` - if you used `isOdd` and `isMultipleofThree` in your last solution, don't use it this time. If you did not, write this method building on your last methods.
- Write a method `fizzMultipleofThree` that takes in an `int` n and prints "Fizz" if n is a multiple of three, and prints n otherwise.

- Write a program that asks the user to type 2 integers A and B and exchange the value of A and B.  

- Write a program that takes two numbers as inputs and returns the largest of them.  

- Write a program which asks for a student's score. Score is a number from 0-100. Your program should translate the number     score into a letter grade and then output the letter grade to the console according to the following criteria:  

        - score = 100 -> "Perfect score!"
        - score >= 90 -> "A"  
        - score >= 80 -> "B"  
        - score >= 70 -> "C"  
        - score >= 60 -> "D"  
        - anything else -> "F"
        - Make sure that your program only prints one grade.
    
- Write a program that asks the user to type an integer and writes "YOU WIN" if the value is between 56 and 78 (both           included). In the other case it writes "YOU LOSE".
